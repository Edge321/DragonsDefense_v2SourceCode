# Introduction
The source code for my game, Dragon's Defense: Wrath of the Villagers!
You can find my game at: https://edgecopecorp.itch.io/dragons-defense-wrath-of-the-villagers?password=dragons
# Layout
Every folder besides the `Design` folder is code for my game. However, blueprints are not included in this section. You can't really show that off as easy as C++ files.
## Design
This is where I create diagrams and plan out all the systems of each class or whatever system that might exist in the game. However, some design documents aren't updated fully, but they get the general idea of the architecture across.
### Point of Interest
The King AI, the biggest system I have ever created in my programming career, is something to check out! You can find it in the `Game` folder.
You can find the general design of The King AI under the `Design` folder.
